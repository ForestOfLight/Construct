The closest thing Bedrock has to **Litematica**. This addon allows you to create and manage ghost structures in your world, making it easier to build them in survival. Construct offers these convenient features:

- **Block Validation**: Highlights incorrectly placed blocks.
- **Easy Place**: Always places blocks correctly.
- **Structure Management**: Create, edit, and delete structures.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a standalone addon, but it is also a **Canopy Extension**, which means **Canopy** can be installed in your world for a few extra features.
> [Download **Canopy** here!](https://github.com/ForestOfLight/Canopy)

## Usage

### Construct Menu

The main Construct menu can be accessed using a `paper` item. Using it will open a GUI where you can manage your structures instances. You can create new instances of structures, edit existing ones, and delete them when you no longer need them. There are plenty options available to customize your building style, including the ability build in layers.

*Pro tip: You can name the paper after a structure instance to automagically select it when you open the menu!*

### Adding New Structures

Construct uses Minecraft's vanilla structure system so that you can easily create and build new structures.

- The simplest way to add a new structure to the structure list is to save it using a structure block.
- Importing structures from other worlds is as simple as dropping the `.mcstructure` file in Construct's `Construct [BP]/structures` folder. Then, to select your structure in the Construct menu, choose "Other" when presented with the structures and enter the filename (without including ".mcstructure"). You only need to do this once with new structures, since Construct will save them for future use!

### Commands

**Usage: `./construct`**
Shows the construct form. Only available when **Canopy** is installed.
